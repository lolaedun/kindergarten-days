            Are you a parent/carer and or a homeschooler? Have you had to self-isolate with your young child? Are you
            looking for ideas to keep your pre-schooler or kindergartner learning in a playful manner? Do you like the idea
            of montessori and waldorf steinar based learning? If so, you are in the right place!

         <h2 class="text-center"> How does it work?</h2>
         <p> Once you register, you have immediate access to inspired activites for the current month. These are
            grouped into weeks and have been designed for the busy parent/grown-up in mind. They are quick snapshots to help
            you plan your week of play-based learning without feeling overwhelmed with large amounts of information to
            impart to your little human. Each week comprises of:
         </p>

            <li>
               <h3>story of the week</h3>

      <h2 class="text-center">Kindergarten Days...</h2>
      <p>
         The life of the Kindergarten child should be largely filled with:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>time spent outdoors</li>
         <li>creative play with natural toys</li>
         <li>modeling activities of the parent (helping them do dishes, cook, clean, care for siblings)</li>
         <li>teaching the older or younger siblings lessons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         Your family schedule should always be the priority. You can choose to follow this schedule as
         little or as much as you would like. Follow the schedule exactly or skip some items.
         Let it be your guide and be there for you
         when you need it as a support system for you and your early childhood angel!
